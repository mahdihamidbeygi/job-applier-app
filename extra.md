To proceed with development, you'll need to:
Set up your environment variables (copy .env.example to .env and fill in your API keys)
Set up a PostgreSQL database and update the connection string
Get API keys for OpenAI and Pinecone
Optionally set up API access for job platforms (LinkedIn, Indeed)
Would you like me to:
Implement more specific features or components?
Add authentication and user management?
Create additional API endpoints?
Set up the database schema and migrations?
Implement specific platform integrations?
Let me know which aspects you'd like to focus on next!
