We seek to empower Canadians to make informed decisions by enabling access to quality, relevant, comprehensive data and insights across the pan-Canadian LMI ecosystem. This facilitates better-informed decision making by employers, workers, job seekers, researchers, policy makers, educators, career practitioners, students, parents, equity-seeking groups and other stakeholders. \n\n\nThis work is performed in the context of a rapidly changing labour market ecosystem, including evolving government/stakeholder needs and products, the availability of high-frequency ‘big data,’ and the growth of private sector LMI providers. LMIC analysis, products, activities, and strategy recommendations must be informed by valid, up-to-date, relevant, and accurate information that reflects the dynamic nature of these factors and their associated interactions. \n\n\nOur efforts are guided through engagement with federal, provincial and territorial governments, intermediary service organizations, academic researchers and private sector partnerships. \n\n\nMore information on the LMIC and its projects can be found at https://lmic-cimt.ca. \n\n\nWork Requirements \n\n\nLMIC is looking for a data scientist to support and effectively leverage LMIC’s cloud-based data infrastructure. The data scientist will be integrated as a core part of LMIC’s team, whose work will leverage LMIC’s cloud-data infrastructure to support senior economists, researchers, and communications initiatives. They will also help integrate metadata schemas from disparate datasets. \n\n\nIn addition, the successful candidate will work with internal and external data architecture experts to support the development of data management pathways for ingesting large streams of data points from various online vendors, public websites and bespoke data files. A critical part of this work will be creating innovative solutions for linking disparate datasets and producing deliverables that LMIC can disseminate to the broader public to better access and understand Canada’s labour market ecosystem. Expertise in SQL, Git, Python, GCP BigQuery or similar experience with R, as well as experience working in a cloud infrastructure (GCP) will be strong assets. Experience with the data ingestion and transformation process would also be an asset. \n\n\nThe data scientist will also be expected to support senior economists and supplement qualitative research by recommending or conducting data analysis and research. This includes cleaning and organizing a variety of data from different sources for one-off use and helping to extract salient insights and patterns in the data. The data scientist will also support the team’s design of empirical research projects that utilize advanced econometrics and statistical approaches to ensure LMIC is leveraging the full potential of available data. \n\n\nKey Responsibilities \n\n\nSupport the development and maintenance of LMIC’s data infrastructure \n\nHelp create and apply metadata schemas \n\nWork with external data architecture experts to support the development of data management pathways for ingesting and transforming large streams of data points from various online vendors, public websites, and bespoke data files \n\nIdentify and link disparate datasets that will create innovate solutions \n\nHelp the data analysis and research being conducted on an ongoing basis by the economics team \n\nClean and organize a variety of data from different sources for one-off use and help to extract salient insights and patterns in the data \n\nSupport the team’s design of empirical research projects that utilize advanced econometrics and statistical approaches \n\nEffectively clean disparate data sources and link structured results within new metadata schemas \n\nProvide recommendations for improving research methods, research tools and information products to ensure the alignment of high-quality approaches \n\n\nQualifications and Knowledge Domains \n\n\nA master’s degree in computer science, economics, or other data-driven field.
